"""
A fluid mechanics problem of incompressible Navier-Stokes flow through a pipe, which is separated by an internal valve (always closed). A 0D model of two 2-element Windkessels in series
bypasses flow from the one region to the other. The setup is rather academic but should illustrate how 0D models can be used to connect independent fluid regions.
